    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div>
        <p><b>Introduction (10 minutes):</b><br></p><p></p><p>Intro to photobooks:</p>

<p></p>

<div><ul><li>Ask
trainees if they like taking pictures of their holidays, family occasions etc.</li><li>Ask
them how they store them to look at them later. How often do they then actually
look at them?</li><li>Create
a link to our photobooks: </li><li>Our
customers are just like you and I. We take photos as memories and later often
just throw them in a box or store them on a computer.....</li><li>Wouldn´t
it be so much nicer to have them bound in a book with good quality printing? We
could just grab it off our bookshelf whenever we want to reminisce about the
good times we had on our last holiday, family party etc.</li><li>Vistaprint
photobooks allow our customers to do exactly that!</li></ul></div>
