points: </p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li><span style="font-weight: normal;">We
     have been asked to find a savings of $3.5MM in the cost of credits.&nbsp; </span></li>
 <li><span style="font-weight: normal;">There
     are three main areas we are looking to target to achieve these savings:</span></li>
</ul>

<ul type="disc">
 <ol start="1" type="1">
  <li><span style="font-weight: normal;">Changing
      our DIFY pricing model - keeping the full $5 fee and stopping the
      practice of converting the fee into a Merchandise Credit (we are
      currently testing this first to make sure it is a sound business move).</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: normal;">Improving
      the quality of Vistaprint products and delivery performance (carrier
      performance in EU seems to be particularly problematic and a good
      opportunity for savings).</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: normal;">Addressing
      areas where we may be exceeding the intent of our “Absolutely Guaranteed”
      satisfaction policy (e.g. giving customers red sale prices during non-red
      sale weeks).</span></li></ol></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;<video width="600" controls="true"><source src="intro/The-Economics-of-Credits-v3.mp4">intro/The-Economics-of-Credits-v3.mp4</video>&nbsp;<br></span></p><br></h5><p><b></b></p>
