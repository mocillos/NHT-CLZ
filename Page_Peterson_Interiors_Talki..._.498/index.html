                <p></p><h5>Main thought</h5><p>This customer loves the Business Card design she has been using. She needs matching products. For our New Hires, it's important to understand that they can use their creativity but that they should be able to dose it and defend it. It's not always about creating what YOU find beautiful, it's also about creating for the customer and matching what they love.</p><h5>Always ask</h5><p></p><ul><li>Did anyone encounter problems when designing?</li><li>How difficult was it to find the image numbers in the library?<br>(remind them that we can GIVE image numbers to our customers, we don't have to keep that info to ourselves)</li></ul><p>Discuss the troubles encountered and ask for input from the group before providing the solution.</p><h5>Talking points</h5><p></p><ul><li>What did you think of the original design?</li><li>Which words would you use to describe the style of the business card, and the style of the products you created - do they match?</li><li>How did you recreate the design to match, but not be exactly the same?<br>(did they use the template or did they build it from scratch (and used the color picker?)</li><li>Does the design created match the original business card?</li><li>(if the design is a complete copy) why did you choose to make it an exact copy? What could be an advantage/disadvantage?</li><li>(if anything is significantly different) why did you make that change and how would you "sell" it to Ms. Peterson?<br><br><br></li><li>What did you design for the back of the&nbsp; postcard? Can you explain? Are there any other ideas for using the back of a postcard?<br>(did they design it as a real postcard to be sent out, or did they design it more like a flyer?)</li><li>Did you add any additional fonts? If yes - can you defend your choice?<br>(using more than three fonts in one design can make the design less appealing)<br><br></li><li>Did anyone put text into the presentation folder flap?<br>Was is clear that text need to be turned?</li><li>Did you notice the possibility to insert a business card into the flaps (in the printed presentation folder)? Did this influence your layout?<br>(for example, if you put a text field with general business information in there, people won't see it if a business card is there (but they'd see it on the business card), but if the business card is taken out, information is still visible)</li><li>How did you manage your layout?<br>(what information should be on the presentation folder (e.g. address info, logo, company name), what information should not (e.g. temporary information like discounts, events)?)<br><br></li><li>Did you figure out any tips and tricks in the Studio that are worth sharing with the group?</li></ul><p></p><h5>Additional exercise</h5><p>Janet Peterson loves the postcard you created but she would like to have it on a different format postcard.<br></p><ul><li>Demo to your New Hires how one can copy a design to a different format (of completely different product)</li><li>Ask them to try it out on their computers<br></li></ul><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><br><p></p>
