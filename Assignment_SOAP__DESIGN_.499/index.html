Ms. Johnson is calling you. She wants to promote her dog grooming salon and has planned a small campaign for which she needs the postcards she designed with her logo and an offer. Unfortunately, now she is calling with a complaint: her package has not arrived and the delivery due date was yesterday.</p><p>Of course you empathize with her and together you figure out that the best solution for her is to receive a reorder: she still wants her postcards and she needs them by the end of next week latest. She is happy with that solution.</p><p><b>Did you realize that before you send off the reorder, there's an additional step to take?<br>You want to check her design to make sure she gets the perfect postcard to promote her business.<br><br></b></p><h5>Steps</h5><p></p><ol><li>Click&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vistaprint.co.uk/vp/gateway.aspx?s=4009498014&amp;preurl=%2fshare-design.aspx%3fdoc_id%3d3683815737%26shopper_id%3d6TI1M6KLR33UFTLMGP3LPJJNRLVO2KWU%26xnav%3dsharesource_8%26share_key%3dcb389e09-6634-4e52-8916-b305b74da397" target="_blank">this link</a>&nbsp;to open her design<br></li><li>Click the Order My Own button and save the design to your own account (log in if necessary)<img src="https://carelearning.ethinksites.com/pluginfile.php/31345/mod_page/content/6/SOAP_NH_EN.png" alt="" width="350" height="141" role="presentation"><br></li><li>Save the design to your own account and&nbsp;<b>then, you can switch to your own locale if you need to</b></li><li>After saving, you can switch to your market's Vistaprint website</li><li>Take any design edits necessary to improve the file<br></li><li><b>Be prepared to show your design in class and "sell" the changes you made to your customer<br><br></b></li></ol><h5>Finishing up</h5><ol><li>Order a PDF proof of your design and save it to your PC.</li><li>Submit the Proof you created for your design below.&nbsp;<br><b>Note: if you've chosen a template with special finishes, a PDF proof is not available.
