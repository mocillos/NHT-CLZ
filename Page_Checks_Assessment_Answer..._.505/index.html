Truman calls CARE to learn more about our Three to a Page Checks. He wants to
know if he can store the checks in a regular 3 ring binder. What should you
advise him?</span></p>

have pre-punched holes that you can put the rings through."</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">B.&nbsp;"That wouldn't be possible as the typical 3 ring
binder is not the same dimension as the checks and would be too small."</span></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-GB">C.&nbsp;"Well a typical 3 ring binder is too small for
these checks. I would recommend the 7 ring Check Binder we offer instead."</span></b></p>
